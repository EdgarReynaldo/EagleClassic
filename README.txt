Hello dear friends,

This is a one time only release of my classic gui library eagle 4. Evertything is as-is, no warranty, express or implied, or otherwise other bs I won't waste your time with.

Feel free to use, re-use, and recycle my code at will granted you give me credit for the original source code.

Right now, the project only builds with MinGW on Windows with mingw32-make. Pass -DALLEGRO_DIR=c:\where\you\installed\allegro4.

make targets are available by typing 'mingw32-make help' at the command line.

There are a couple compile scripts for the two included eagle demos that work with the allegro 4 distribution I provide.

Profiling targets are no longer supported as gprof is hopelessly broken.

If you find my code useful, insightful, or entertaining in any way, feel free to drop me a line at edgarreynaldo@members.allegro.cc anytime.

Edgar
